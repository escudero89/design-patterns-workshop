# Abstract Factory Pattern

Welcome to the Abstract Factory Pattern example! This folder contains a TypeScript implementation of the Abstract Factory design pattern. The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Introduction

The Abstract Factory pattern is a **creational design pattern** that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is particularly useful when a system needs to be independent of the way its objects are created, composed, and represented.

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine a furniture company that produces different styles of furniture (e.g., Victorian, Modern). Each style includes various pieces like chairs, tables, and sofas. An Abstract Factory is like a catalog for each style that provides the means to create all the related pieces of furniture without specifying the exact class for each piece.

## Applicability

Use the Abstract Factory pattern when:

- A system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.
- A system should be configured with one of multiple families of products.
- A family of related product objects is designed to be used together, and you need to enforce this constraint.
- You want to provide a library of products without exposing their implementations.

## Implementation

The implementation of the Abstract Factory pattern is provided in the [`pattern.ts`](./pattern.ts) file.

## Pros and Cons

| Pros                                                                   | Cons                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Ensures Consistency: Families of related objects are used together     | Complex to implement with many product families   |
| Encapsulation: Hides the concrete product classes                      | Adding new products requires updating the factory |
| Promotes Loose Coupling: Client code is decoupled from object creation | Can introduce more classes and interfaces         |

## Usage

To use the Abstract Factory pattern in your TypeScript project, follow these steps:

1. **Define the Abstract Factory Interface:**

   - Create an interface that declares methods for creating each product.

2. **Implement Concrete Factories:**

   - Create classes that implement the Abstract Factory interface. Each concrete factory creates products for a specific family.

3. **Define Abstract Products:**

   - Create interfaces for each type of product that the factory can create.

4. **Implement Concrete Products:**

   - Create classes that implement the product interfaces.

5. **Use the Factory:**

   - Create instances of the concrete factories and use them to create products.

## Getting Started

To run the examples in this folder, use the following commands after building the project as described in the main [README](../../../../README.md):

```bash
node lib/src/examples/creational/abstract-factory/pattern.js
node lib/src/examples/creational/abstract-factory/task.js
node lib/src/examples/creational/abstract-factory/result.js
```
